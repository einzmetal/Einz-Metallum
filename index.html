<h1>Metal!! \m/</h1>
<p>And more</p><br>
  
  <p>Most of the best things in life are in the form of either: science, metal, or beer, I guess</p>
  <p>This will be a site sharing knowledge I have of these, and of course adding or revising 
    information as I continue to learn about these subjects myself</p>
<p>Here are some links to resources I often use, and will be available on the various pages of this site!</p>
