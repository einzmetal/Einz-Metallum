<h1>Lesson layout and example</h1>
<p>So this is where I'll explain the lick/lesson. For example, I'll walk you through something I've written myself.</p><br>
<p>I'll call this the <i>&quotbeta&quot</i> lick, since this is my beta page for the lesson layout. Why not</p>
<p>This is an exercise I wrote after trying to figure out the picking pattern for the ending lick of the guitar solo
in &quotDressed to Kill&quot by Symphony X. I had to learn what economy picking was and how to use it, so I tried a lot of ways.
One that I liked was sorta reversing it in another key.</p><br>
<p>I'll link the tabs and video for the SX lick at the bottom</p><br>
<pre><p>So any odd number of notes per string will be an easier exercise
 for economy picking (see some other fucking lesson), but this one will
 start on the 5th string and go to the first using a combination of 3 and 6 notes per string, as
 well as sweeping and alternate picking (see more basic shit). 
 This is not easy. For odd notes per string above 1, a rolling motion of the pick
 is recommended (in my experience). And this might be tricky at first, 
 but it becomes fluid fairly quickly if you stick to making the &quotcircls&quot. 
 I digress. Starting with a down stroke, you fall from the 5th to 4th string, 
 meaning they are both down strokes, and end the 9 note pattern on an up stroke. 
 Then I like to think I'm pushing through the direction change and 
 <i>hammer</i> the 3rd string, proceeding through the same pattern. And 
 after 9 notes, I hammer again on the 1st string before ending the lick with a sweep.</p>
